# Commodore PET Keycaps
A custom keycap set modeled after the chicklet keyboard of the original [Commodore PET 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET) 8-bit computer.

## About
These keycaps are part of a father/son project to build a [homebrew clone](https://github.com/DLehenbauer/commodore-pet-clone) of the Commodore PET.

Possibly these are also of interest to users of the [xPet VICE emulator](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/) with the 'US Graphic Positional' layout.

## Hardware
Keycaps will work with any mechanical keyboard meeting the following requirements:
* Cherry MX compatible switches
* ANSI 104-key layout.
* 6.25x spacebar (has 7 equally sized OS/meta keys on the bottom row)

I used the [Velocifire VM02WS](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08L8QSTLY) keyboard.  (Note that the Velocifire has backlit keys, but these keycaps are opaque.)

## Ordering
**Important**: The print color of the keycaps is determined by the *.svg file, not the web editor.  If you choose a different color scheme for the keycap plastic, please also modify the colors in the SVG file to avoid "black-on-black" or "white-on-white".
